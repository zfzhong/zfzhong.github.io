Zifei Zhong (zhongz@email.sc.edu)

I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of South
Carolina, specializing in mmWave sensing, robotics, IoT, and mobile
systems. I initially pursued my Ph.D. studies at the University of
Texas at Austin before deciding to embark on a journey in
entrepreneurship in 2009. After gaining valuable experience in the
Internet Technology industry for over 10 years, I made the decision to
return to academia and complete my Ph.D. Currently, I am fortunate to
be collaborating with my long-time friend and advisor, Prof. Srihari
Nelakuditi, on various research projects. I am passionate about
advancing the field of Computer Science and leveraging cutting-edge
technologies to solve real-world challenges.
