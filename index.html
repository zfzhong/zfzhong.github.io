<p>I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.cse.sc.edu/">University of South Carolina</a>, specializing in mmWave sensing, robotics, IoT, and mobile systems. I initially pursued my Ph.D. studies at the <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/">University of Texas at Austin</a> before deciding to embark on a journey in entrepreneurship in 2009. After gaining valuable experience in the Internet Technology industry for over 10 years, I made the decision to return to academia and complete my Ph.D. Currently, I am fortunate to be collaborating with my long-time friend and advisor, Prof. <a href="https://www.cse.sc.edu/~srihari/">Srihari Nelakuditi</a>, on various research projects. I am passionate about advancing the field of Computer Science and leveraging cutting-edge technologies to solve real-world challenges.</p>
