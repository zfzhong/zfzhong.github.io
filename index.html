I am Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of South
Carolina. Previously, I was a Ph.D student at the University of Texas
at Austin. In 2009, I dropped out from the Ph.D. proram to found
startups. After working in the Internet Techonology industry for over
10 years, I decided to return to university and finish my Ph.D. I am
working with my long-term friend and advisor Prof. Srihari Nelakuditi.
